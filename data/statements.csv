10/05/1999,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged.   Strengthening productivity growth has been fostering favorable trends in unit costs and prices and much recent information suggests that these trends have been sustained.   Nonetheless the growth of demand has continued to outpace that of supply as evidenced by a decreasing pool of available workers willing to take jobs.   In these circumstances the Federal Open Market Committee will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for costs to increase significantly in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation pressures and undermine the impressive performance of the economy. Against this background the Committee adopted a directive that was biased toward a possible firming of policy going forward.   Committee members emphasized that such a directive did not signify a commitment to near-term action.   The Committee will need to evaluate additional information on the balance of aggregate supply and demand and conditions in financial markets.    "
18/05/1999,"		While the FOMC did not take action today to alter the stance of monetary policy the Committee was concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable performance of the economy and therefore adopted a directive that is tilted toward the possibility of a  firming in the stance of monetary policy.   Trend increases in costs and core prices have generally remained quite subdued.   But domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary policy last fall.   Against the background of already-tight domestic labor markets and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains the Committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no longer be consistent with containing inflation.  "
30/06/1999,"	Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary pressures. 	Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward the FOMC has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action.   The Committee nonetheless recognizes that in the current dynamic environment it must be especially alert to the emergence or potential emergence of inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth.  "
24/08/1999,"	  With financial markets functioning more normally and with persistent strength in domestic demand foreign economies firming and labor markets remaining very tight  the degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial market turmoil of last fall is no longer consistent with sustained noninflationary  economic expansion.    	Today's increase in the federal funds rate together with the policy action in June and the firming of conditions more generally in U. S.  financial markets over recent months should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going forward.   As a consequence the directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term. 	In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston New York Philadelphia Cleveland Richmond Atlanta Chicago St.  Louis Kansas City  and San Francisco.   The discount rate is the interest rate that is charged depository institutions when they borrow from their district Federal Reserve Banks.   "
16/11/1999,"	The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5-1/2 percent.   In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 5 percent. Although cost pressures appear generally contained risks to sustainable growth persist.  Despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential.   As a consequence the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months a trend that must eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue. Today's increase in the federal funds rate together with the policy actions in June and August and the firming of conditions more generally in U. S.  financial markets over the course of the year should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward.   As a consequence the directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term. In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston Cleveland Richmond and Kansas City.   The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.  "
21/12/1999,"The Federal Open Market Committee made no change today in its target for the federal funds rate.   Based on the available evidence however the Committee remains concerned with the possibility that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply even after taking account of the remarkable rise in productivity growth.   Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's exemplary performance.   Nonetheless in light of market uncertainties associated with the century date change the Committee decided to adopt a symmetric directive in order to indicate that the focus of policy in the intermeeting period must be ensuring a smooth transition into the Year 2000.   At its next meeting the Committee will assess available information on the likely balance of supply and demand conditions in financial markets and the possible need for adjustment in the stance of policy to contain inflationary pressures.  "
02/02/2000,"The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5-3/4 percent.   In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent.   The Committee remains concerned that over time increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply even after taking account of the pronounced rise in productivity growth.   Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion.   Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future. 	In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston New York Philadelphia Cleveland Richmond Atlanta Chicago St.  Louis Kansas City and San Francisco.   The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.  "
10/03/2000,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 6-1/2 percent. Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand has moderated to a pace closer to the enhanced rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce.  The more rapid advances in productivity also continue to help contain costs and hold down underlying price pressures.   However the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level.  Moreover the increase in energy prices though having limited effect on core measures of prices to date poses a risk of raising inflation expectations.   The subdued behavior of those expectations so far has contributed importantly to maintaining an environment conducive to maximum sustainable growth.   Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the Committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the future.    "
21/03/2000,"The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent.  In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 5-1/2 percent.  Economic conditions and considerations addressed by the Committee are essentially the same as when the Committee met in February.  The Committee remains concerned that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion.  Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.  In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston New York Philadelphia Cleveland Richmond Atlanta Chicago St.  Louis Minneapolis Kansas City and San Francisco.  The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.    "
16/05/2000,"The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 6-1/2 percent.   In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate to 6 percent. Increases in demand have remained in excess of even the rapid pace of productivity-driven gains in potential supply exerting continued pressure on resources.   The Committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth of demand and potential supply will continue which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance. Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information already available the Committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future. 	In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston Cleveland Richmond and San Francisco.   The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.  "
28/06/2000,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 6-1/2 percent.   Recent data suggest that the expansion of aggregate demand may be moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce.   Although core measures of prices are rising slightly faster than a year ago continuing rapid advances in productivity have been containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures.    Nonetheless signs that growth in demand is moving to a sustainable pace are still tentative and preliminary and the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level. In these circumstances and against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the Committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.  "
22/08/2000,"	The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 6-1/2 percent. 	Recent data have indicated that the expansion of aggregate demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce.   The data also have indicated that more rapid advances in productivity have been raising that potential growth rate as well as containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures. 	Nonetheless the Committee remains concerned about the risk of a continuing gap between the growth of demand and potential supply at a time when the utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level. 	Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the Committee believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.  "
15/11/2000,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 6-1/2 percent.  The utilization of the pool of available workers remains at an unusually high level and the increase in energy prices though having limited effect on core measures of prices to date still harbors the possibility of raising inflation expectations.  The Committee accordingly continues to see a risk of heightened inflation pressures.  However softening in business and household demand and tightening conditions in financial markets over recent months suggest that the economy could expand for a time at a pace below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential to produce.     Nonetheless to date the easing of demand pressures has not been sufficient to warrant a change in the Committee's judgment that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.   "
19/12/2000,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy keeping its target for the federal funds rate at 6-1/2 percent.  The drag on demand and profits from rising energy costs as well as eroding consumer confidence reports of substantial shortfalls in sales and earnings and stress in some segments of the financial markets suggest that economic growth may be slowing further.   While some inflation risks persist they are diminished by the more moderate pace of economic activity and by the absence of any indication that longer-term inflation expectations have increased.   The Committee will continue to monitor closely the evolving economic situation.   Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the Committee consequently believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.    "
31/01/2001,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5-1/2 percent.  In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 5 percent.    Consumer and business confidence has eroded further exacerbated by rising energy costs that continue to drain consumer purchasing power and press on business profit margins.   Partly as a consequence retail sales and business spending on capital equipment have weakened appreciably.  In response manufacturing production has been cut back sharply with new technologies appearing to have accelerated the response of production and demand to potential excesses in the stock of inventories and capital equipment.   Taken together and with inflation contained these circumstances have called for a rapid and forceful response of monetary policy.   The longer-term advances in technology and accompanying gains in productivity however exhibit few signs of abating and these gains along with the lower interest rates should support growth of the economy over time.   Nonetheless the Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.   In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York Philadelphia Cleveland Atlanta Chicago St.  Louis Minneapolis Dallas and San Francisco.    "
10/02/2001,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 2-1/2 percent.  In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 2 percent. The terrorist attacks have significantly heightened uncertainty in an economy that was already weak.   Business and household spending as a consequence are being further damped.   Nonetheless the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate.  The Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.        In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests         submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston         New York Cleveland Richmond Atlanta St.  Louis Kansas City and San         Francisco.                               "
01/03/2001,"	The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 6 percent. 	In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 5-3/4 percent the level requested by seven Reserve Banks.   The Board also indicated that it stands ready to approve a further reduction of 25 basis points in the discount rate to 5-1/2 percent on the requests of Federal Reserve Banks. 	These actions were taken in light of further weakening of sales and production and in the context of lower consumer confidence tight conditions in some segments of financial markets and high energy prices sapping household and business purchasing power.   Moreover inflation pressures remain contained.   Nonetheless to date there is little evidence to suggest that longer-term advances in technology and associated gains in productivity are abating. 	The Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. 	In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York Cleveland AtlantaSt.  Louis Kansas City Dallas and San Francisco.  "
20/03/2001,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5 percent.  In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 4-1/2 percent. Persistent pressures on profit margins are restraining investment spending and through declines in equity wealth consumption.  The associated backup in inventories has induced a rapid response in manufacturing output and with spending having firmed a bit since last year inventory adjustment appears to be well underway. Although current developments do not appear to have materially diminished the prospects for long-term growth in productivity excess productive capacity has emerged recently.   The possibility that this excess could continue for some time and the potential for weakness in global economic conditions suggest substantial risks that demand and production could remain soft.   In these circumstances when the economic situation could be evolving rapidly the Federal Reserve will need to monitor developments closely. The Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of all twelve Reserve Banks.    "
18/04/2001,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 4-1/2 percent.   In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 4 percent.   The FOMC has reviewed prospects for the economy in light of the information that has become available since its March meeting.   A significant reduction in excess inventories seems well advanced.   Consumption and housing expenditures have held up reasonably well though activity in these areas has flattened recently.   Although measured productivity probably weakened in the first quarter the impressive underlying rate of increase that developed in recent years appears to be largely intact.   Nonetheless capital investment has continued to soften and the persistent erosion in current and expected profitability in combination with rising uncertainty about the business outlook seems poised to dampen capital spending going forward.   This potential restraint together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak.   As a consequence the Committee agreed that an adjustment in the stance of policy is warranted during this extended intermeeting period.  The Committee continues to believe that against thebackground of its long-run goals of price stability andsustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.   In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston New York Philadelphia Cleveland Atlanta Minneapolis Dallas and San Francisco.  "

In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 3-1/2 percent.   A significant reduction in excess inventories seems well advanced.  Consumption and housing expenditures have held up reasonably well though activity in these areas has flattened recently.  Investment in capital equipment however has continued to decline.  The erosion in current and prospective profitability in combination with considerable uncertainty about the business outlook seems likely to hold down capital spending going forward.  This potential restraint together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad continues to weigh on the economy.    With pressures on labor and product markets easing inflation is expected to remain contained.   Although measured productivity growth stalled in the first quarter the impressive underlying rate of increase that developed in recent years appears to be largely intact supporting longer-term prospects. The Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.   In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York Richmond Chicago St.  Louis and San Francisco.  "
11/06/2001,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 2 percent.  In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 1-1/2 percent. Heightened uncertainty and concerns about a deterioration in business conditions both here and abroad are damping economic activity.  For the foreseeable future then the Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness.  Although the necessary reallocation of resources to enhance security may restrain advances in productivity for a time the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate. 	In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved the request submitted by the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.  "
27/06/2001,"The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3-3/4 percent.   In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 3-1/4 percent.   Today's action by the FOMC brings the decline in the target federal funds rate since the beginning of the year to 275 basis points.   The patterns evident in recent months--declining profitability and business capital spending weak expansion of consumption and slowing growth abroad--continue to weigh on the economy.   The associated easing of pressures on labor and product markets is expected to keep inflation contained. Although continuing favorable trends bolster long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy the Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.   In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston New York Philadelphia Atlanta Chicago Dallas and San Francisco.  "

Today's action by the FOMC brings the decline in the target federal funds rate since the beginning of the year to 300 basis points.  	Household demand has been sustained but business profits and capital spending continue to weaken and growth abroad is slowing weighing on the U.

The associated easing of pressures on labor and product markets is expected to keep inflation contained. 	Although long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable the Committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.   	In taking the discount rate action the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston New York Philadelphia Richmond Chicago Kansas City and Dallas.   "
17/09/2001,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 3 percent.   In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 2-1/2 percent.   The Federal Reserve will continue to supply unusually large volumes of liquidity to the financial markets as needed until more normal market functioning is restored.   As a consequence the FOMC recognizes that the actual federal funds rate may be below its target on occasion in these unusual circumstances. 	Even before the tragic events of last week employment production and business spending remained weak and last week's events have the potential to damp spending further. Nonetheless the long-term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate.

With the forces restraining the economy starting to diminish and with the long-term prospects for productivity growth remaining favorable and monetary policy accommodative the outlook for economic recovery has become more promising. The degree of any strength in business capital and household spending however is still uncertain.

The Committee believes that as those uncertainties lift as most analysts expect the accommodative stance of monetary policy coupled with ongoing growth in productivity will provide support to economic activity sufficient to engender an improving economic climate over time. In light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decisionmaking the Committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks with respect to the prospects for its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth.   Rather the Committee decided to refrain from making that determination until some of those uncertainties abate.

Aggregate spending despite high energy prices appears to have strengthened since late winter and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.   Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated.

The widespread devastation in the Gulf region the associated dislocation of economic activity and the boost to energy prices imply that spending production and employment will be set back in the near term.   In addition to elevating premiums for some energy products the disruption to the production and refining infrastructure may add to energy price volatility. 	While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about near-term economic performance it is the Committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat.   Rather monetary policy accommodation coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity.   Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures.   However core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. 	The Committee perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.

28/03/2006,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-3/4 percent.  The slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected temporary or special factors.  Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace.  As yet the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check and inflation expectations remain contained.  Still possible increases in resource utilization in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to add to inflation pressures.  The Committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.  In any event the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.

10/05/2006,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 percent. Economic growth has been quite strong so far this year.  The Committee sees growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. As yet the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check and inflation expectations remain contained.  Still possible increases in resource utilization in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to add to inflation pressures. The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.  In any event the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.  In a related action the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 6 percent.

29/06/2006,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5-1/4 percent. Recent indicators suggest that economic growth is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier this year partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. Readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months.  Ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs and inflation expectations remain contained.  However the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures. Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information.  In any event the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives.  In a related action the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 6-1/4 percent.

08/08/2006,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  Economic growth has moderated from its quite strong pace earlier this year partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. Readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months and the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  However inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand. Nonetheless the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information.

20/09/2006,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. The moderation in economic growth appears to be continuing partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market. Readings on core inflation have been elevated and the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  However inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.

25/10/2006,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Economic growth has slowed over the course of the year partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market.  Going forward the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace.  Readings on core inflation have been elevated and the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  However inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.

Economic growth has slowed over the course of the year partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market.  Although recent indicators have been mixed the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters. Readings on core inflation have been elevated and the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  However inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand.

31/01/2007,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  Recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market.  Overall the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time.  However the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures.  The Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information.   
21/03/2007,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Recent indicators have been mixed and the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing.  Nevertheless the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  Recent readings on core inflation have been somewhat elevated.  Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures. In these circumstances the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.  Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information.  
09/05/2007,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  Economic growth slowed in the first part of this year and the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing.  Nevertheless the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.  Core inflation remains somewhat elevated.  Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures.  In these circumstances the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.  Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information.  
28/06/2007,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent.  Economic growth appears to have been moderate during the first half of this year despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector.  The economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months.  However a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.  Moreover the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures. In these circumstances the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.  Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information. 
07/08/2007,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year.  Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses and the housing correction is ongoing.  Nevertheless the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months.  However a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.  Moreover the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures. Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.  Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information.  
10/08/2007,The Federal Reserve is providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of financial markets. The Federal Reserve will provide reserves as necessary through open market operations to promote trading in the federal funds market at rates close to the Federal Open Market Committee's target rate of 5-1/4 percent.  In current circumstances depository institutions may experience unusual funding needs because of dislocations in money and credit markets.  As always the discount window is available as a source of funding. 
17/08/2007,Financial market conditions have deteriorated and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward.  In these circumstances although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace the Federal Open Market Committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably.  The Committee is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.  
18/09/2007,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 4-3/4 percent. Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally.  Todays action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.  Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year.  However the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.  Developments in financial markets since the Committees last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.   In a related action the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent.  In taking this action the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston New York Cleveland St.  Louis Minneapolis Kansas City and San Francisco. 
31/10/2007,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/2 percent. Economic growth was solid in the third quarter and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance.  However the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction.  Todays action combined with the policy action taken in September should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time. Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year but recent increases in energy and commodity prices among other factors may put renewed upward pressure on inflation.  In this context the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. The Committee judges that after this action the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.   Voting against was Thomas M.  Hoenig who preferred no change in the federal funds rate at this meeting. In a related action the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 5 percent.  In taking this action the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York Richmond Atlanta Chicago St.  Louis and San Francisco. 
11/12/2007,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/4 percent. Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending.  Moreover strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks.  Todays action combined with the policy actions taken earlier should help promote moderate growth over time.  Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year but elevated energy and commodity prices among other factors may put upward pressure on inflation.  In this context the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Recent developments including the deterioration in financial market conditions have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.   Voting against was Eric S.  Rosengren who preferred to lower the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at this meeting. In a related action the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 4-3/4 percent.  In taking this action the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York Philadelphia Cleveland Richmond Atlanta Chicago and St.  Louis. 
22/01/2008,The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 3-1/2 percent. The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth.  While strains in short-term funding markets have eased somewhat broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households.  Moreover incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Appreciable downside risks to growth remain.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.   Voting against was  Poole who did not believe that current conditions justified policy action before the regularly scheduled meeting next week.  Absent and not voting was Frederic S.  Mishkin. In a related action the Board of Governors approved a 75-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 4 percent.  In taking this action the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Minneapolis. 
30/01/2008,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 3 percent. Financial markets remain under considerable stress and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households.  Moreover recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Todays policy action combined with those taken earlier should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.  However downside risks to growth remain.  The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.   Voting against was Richard W.  Fisher who preferred no change in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  In a related action the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 3-1/2 percent.

11/03/2008,"Since the coordinated actions taken in December 2007 the G-10 central banks have continued to work together closely and to consult regularly on liquidity pressures in funding markets.  Pressures in some of these markets have recently increased again.  We all continue to work together and will take appropriate steps to address those liquidity pressures.  To that end today the Bank of Canada the Bank of England the European Central Bank the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank are announcing specific measures. The Federal Reserve announced today an expansion of its securities lending program.  Under this new Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) the Federal Reserve will lend up to $200 billion of Treasury securities to primary dealers secured for a term of 28 days (rather than overnight as in the existing program) by a pledge of other securities including federal agency debt federal agency residential-mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and non-agency AAA/Aaa-rated private-label residential MBS.  The TSLF is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally.  As is the case with the current securities lending program securities will be made available through an auction process.  Auctions will be held on a weekly basis beginning on March 27 2008.  The Federal Reserve will consult with primary dealers on technical design features of the TSLF. In addition the Federal Open Market Committee has authorized increases in its existing temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB).  These arrangements will now provide dollars in amounts of up to $30 billion and $6 billion to the ECB and the SNB respectively representing increases of $10 billion and $2 billion.  The FOMC extended the term of these swap lines through September 30 2008. The actions announced today supplement the measures announced by the Federal Reserve on Friday to boost the size of the Term Auction Facility to $100 billion and to undertake a series of term repurchase transactions that will cumulate to $100 billion. Information on the actions that will be taken by other central banks is available at the following websites:     "
18/03/2008,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 2-1/4 percent. Recent information indicates that the outlook for economic activity has weakened further.  Growth in consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened.  Financial markets remain under considerable stress and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Inflation has been elevated and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen.  The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization.  Still uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased.  It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Todays policy action combined with those taken earlier including measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.  However downside risks to growth remain.  The Committee will act in a timely manner as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. Voting against were Richard W.  Fisher and Charles I.  Plosser who preferred less aggressive action at this meeting.  In a related action the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 75-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 2-1/2 percent.  In taking this action the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston New York and San Francisco. 
30/04/2008,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2 percent.  Recent information indicates that economic activity remains weak.  Household and business spending has been subdued and labor markets have softened further.  Financial markets remain under considerable stress and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat energy and other commodity prices have increased and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months.  The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization.  Still uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high.  It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.  The substantial easing of monetary policy to date combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity.  The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.    Voting against were Richard W.  Fisher and Charles I.  Plosser who preferred no change in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting. In a related action the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 2-1/4 percent.  In taking this action the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York Cleveland Atlanta and San Francisco. 
25/06/2008,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent. Recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand partly reflecting some firming in household spending.  However labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress.  Tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year.  However in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. The substantial easing of monetary policy to date combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate growth over time.  Although downside risks to growth remain they appear to have diminished somewhat and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased.  The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.   Voting against was Richard W.  Fisher who preferred an increase in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting. 
05/08/2008,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent. Economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports.  However labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress.  Tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.  Over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth. Inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated.  The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. Although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the Committee.  The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.   Voting against was Richard W.  Fisher who preferred an increase in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting. 
16/09/2008,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent. Strains in financial markets have increased significantly and labor markets have weakened further.  Economic growth appears to have slowed recently partly reflecting a softening of household spending.  Tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and some slowing in export growth are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters.  Over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth. Inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities.  The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern to the Committee.  The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. 
08/10/2008," Throughout the current financial crisis central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets. Inflationary pressures have started to moderate in a number of countries partly reflecting a marked decline in energy and other commodity prices. Inflation expectations are diminishing and remain anchored to price stability. The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability.  Some easing of global monetary conditions is therefore warranted. Accordingly the Bank of Canada the Bank of England the European Central Bank the Federal Reserve Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing reductions in policy interest rates. The Bank of Japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions. The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1-1/2 percent. The Committee took this action in light of evidence pointing to a weakening of economic activity and a reduction in inflationary pressures.  Incoming economic data suggest that the pace of economic activity has slowed markedly in recent months. Moreover the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit. Inflation has been high but the Committee believes that the decline in energy and other commodity prices and the weaker prospects for economic activity have reduced the upside risks to inflation.  The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.    In a related action the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 1-3/4 percent.  In taking this action the Board approved the request submitted by the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Information on the actions that will be taken by other central banks is available at the following websites:   "
29/10/2008,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent. The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures.  Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened in recent months and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for U. S.  exports.  Moreover the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability. Recent policy actions including todays rate reduction coordinated interest rate cuts by central banks extraordinary liquidity measures and official steps to strengthen financial systems should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to moderate economic growth.  Nevertheless downside risks to growth remain.  The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.   In a related action the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 1-1/4 percent.  In taking this action the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston New York Cleveland and San Francisco. 
16/12/2008,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent.  Since the Committee's last meeting labor market conditions have deteriorated and the available data indicate that consumer spending business investment and industrial production have declined.  Financial markets remain quite strained and credit conditions tight.  Overall the outlook for economic activity has weakened further. Meanwhile inflationary pressures have diminished appreciably.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity the Committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming quarters. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.  In particular the Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.  The focus of the Committee's policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level.  As previously announced over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant.  The Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.  Early next year the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Federal Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity.  In a related action the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 75-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 1/2 percent.  In taking this action the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York Cleveland Richmond Atlanta Minneapolis and San Francisco.  The Board also established interest rates on required and excess reserve balances of 1/4percent.  
28/01/2009,The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the economy has weakened further. Industrial production housing starts and employment have continued to decline steeply as consumers and businesses have cut back spending. Furthermore global demand appears to be slowing significantly. Conditions in some financial markets have improved in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight. The Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year but the downside risks to that outlook are significant. In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the prospects for considerable economic slack the Committee expects that inflation pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters. Moreover the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. The focus of the Committee's policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level. The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant. The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets. The Federal Reserve will be implementing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses. The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.  Voting against was Jeffrey M.  Lacker who preferred to expand the monetary base at this time by purchasing U. S.  Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programs. 
18/03/2009,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the economy continues to contract.  Job losses declining equity and housing wealth and tight credit conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending.  Weaker sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed investment.  U. S.  exports have slumped as a number of major trading partners have also fallen into recession.  Although the near-term economic outlook is weak the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions together with fiscal and monetary stimulus will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth. In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued.  Moreover the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. In these circumstances the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  To provide greater support to mortgage lending and housing markets the Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserves balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities bringing its total purchases of these securities to up to $1. 25 trillion this year and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by up to $100 billion to a total of up to $200 billion.  Moreover to help improve conditions in private credit markets the Committee decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months.  The Federal Reserve has launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates that the range of eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be expanded to include other financial assets.  The Committee will continue to carefully monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial and economic developments.  
29/04/2009,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the economy has continued to contract though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower.  Household spending has shown signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses lower housing wealth and tight credit.  Weak sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories fixed investment and staffing.  Although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time.  Nonetheless the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions fiscal and monetary stimulus and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability. In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued.  Moreover the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term. In these circumstances the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  As previously announced to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1. 25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year.  In addition the Federal Reserve will buy up to $300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is facilitating the extension of credit to households and businesses and supporting the functioning of financial markets through a range of liquidity programs.  The Committee will continue to carefully monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of financial and economic developments.  
24/06/2009,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the pace of economic contraction is slowing.  Conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months.  Household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses lower housing wealth and tight credit.  Businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions fiscal and monetary stimulus and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability. The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late.  However substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures and the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. In these circumstances the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.

12/08/2009,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity is leveling out.  Conditions in financial markets have improved further in recent weeks.  Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses sluggish income growth lower housing wealth and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions fiscal and monetary stimulus and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.

In addition the Federal Reserve is in the process of buying $300 billion of Treasury securities.  To promote a smooth transition in markets as these purchases of Treasury securities are completed the Committee has decided to gradually slow the pace of these transactions and anticipates that the full amount will be purchased by the end of October.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.   
23/09/2009,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn.  Conditions in financial markets have improved further and activity in the housing sector has increased.  Household spending seems to be stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses sluggish income growth lower housing wealth and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions fiscal and monetary stimulus and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time. In these circumstances the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $1. 25trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt.  The Committee will gradually slow the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipates that they will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  As previously announced the Federal Reserves purchases of $300billion of Treasury securities will be completed by the end of October 2009.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.  
04/11/2009,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has continued to pick up.  Conditions in financial markets were roughly unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period.  Activity in the housing sector has increased over recent months.  Household spending appears to be expanding but remains constrained by ongoing job losses sluggish income growth lower housing wealth and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions fiscal and monetary stimulus and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.

In these circumstances the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions including low rates of resource utilization subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $1. 25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt.  The amount of agency debt purchases while somewhat less than the previously announced maximum of $200 billion is consistent with the recent path of purchases and reflects the limited availability of agency debt.  In order to promote a smooth transition in markets the Committee will gradually slow the pace of its purchases of both agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities and anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.

These facilities include the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility the Commercial Paper Funding Facility the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the Term Securities Lending Facility.  The Federal Reserve will also be working with its central bank counterparties to close its temporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1.  The Federal Reserve expects that amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility will continue to be scaled back in early 2010.  The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30 2010 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31 2010 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

09/05/2010,In response to the reemergence of strains in U. S.  dollar short-term funding markets in Europe the Bank of Canada the Bank of England the European Central Bank the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank are announcing the reestablishment of temporary U. S.  dollar liquidity swap facilities. These facilities are designed to help improve liquidity conditions in U. S.  dollar funding markets and to prevent the spread of strains to other markets and financial centers. The Bank of Japan will be considering similar measures soon. Central banks will continue to work together closely as needed to address pressures in funding markets.  The Federal Open Market Committee has authorized temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with the Bank of Canada the Bank of England the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank. The arrangements with the Bank of England the ECB and the Swiss National Bank will provide these central banks with the capacity to conduct tenders of U. S.  dollars in their local markets at fixed rates for full allotment similar to arrangements that had been in place previously. The arrangement with the Bank of Canada would support drawings of up to $30 billion as was the case previously.  These swap arrangements have been authorized through January 2011.

21/09/2010,"       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months.  Household spending is increasing gradually but remains constrained by high unemployment modest income growth lower housing wealth and tight credit.  Business spending on equipment and software is rising though less rapidly than earlier in the year while investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak.  Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  Housing starts are at a depressed level.  Bank lending has continued to contract but at a reduced rate in recent months.  The Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be modest in the near term.            Measures of underlying inflation are currently at levels somewhat below those the Committee judges most consistent over the longer run with its mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.  With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable inflation is likely to remain subdued for some time before rising to levels the Committee considers consistent with its mandate.            The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions including low rates of resource utilization subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.  The Committee also will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings.            The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and is prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation over time to levels consistent with its mandate.            Voting against the policy was Thomas M.  Hoenig who judged that the economy continues to recover at a moderate pace.

25/01/2012,"       Following careful deliberations at its recent meetings the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has reached broad agreement on the following principles regarding its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy. The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January.            The FOMC is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses reduces economic and financial uncertainty increases the effectiveness of monetary policy and enhances transparency and accountability which are essential in a democratic society.            Inflation employment and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Moreover monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals its medium-term outlook and its assessments of the balance of risks including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.            The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate.  Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.            The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. For example in the most recent projections FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5. 2 percent to 6. 0 percent roughly unchanged from last January but substantially higher than the corresponding interval several years earlier.            In setting monetary policy the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level.  These objectives are generally complementary. However under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary it follows a balanced approach in promoting them taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.                                      "
25/01/2012,"       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately notwithstanding some slowing in global growth.

Inflation has been subdued in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.            Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that over coming quarters inflation will run at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.            To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation over time is at levels consistent with the dual mandate the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.            The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September.

The recent increase in oil and gasoline prices will push up inflation temporarily but the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.            To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.            The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.

20/06/2012,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately this year.  However growth in employment has slowed in recent months and the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Business fixed investment has continued to advance.  Household spending appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.  Despite some signs of improvement the housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation has declined mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities.  Specifically the Committee intends to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years at the current pace and to sell or redeem an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less.  This continuation of the maturity extension program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.

13/09/2012,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.  Growth in employment has been slow and the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending has continued to advance but growth in business fixed investment appears to have slowed.  The housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement albeit from a depressed level.  Inflation has been subdued although the prices of some key commodities have increased recently.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee is concerned that without further policy accommodation economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.  Furthermore strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate the Committee agreed today to increase policy accommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month.  The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  These actions which together will increase the Committee holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months.  If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities undertake additional asset purchases and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.  In determining the size pace and composition of its asset purchases the Committee will as always take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.

18/09/2013,"       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.  Some indicators of labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced and the housing sector has been strengthening but mortgage rates have risen further and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.  Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.            Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that with appropriate policy accommodation economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished on net since last fall but the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months if sustained could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market.  The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.            Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.  However the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases.  Accordingly the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.            The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.

If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.  However asset purchases are not on a preset course and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.            To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial developments.  The Committee continues to anticipate based on its assessment of these factors that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.            When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels economic conditions may for some time warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.           Voting against was Charles I.  Plosser who objected to the guidance indicating that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for ""a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends"" because such language is time dependent and does not reflect the considerable economic progress that has been made toward the Committee's goals.                 "
17/09/2014,"       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.  On balance labor market conditions improved somewhat further; however the unemployment rate is little changed and a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources.  Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.  Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth although the extent of restraint is diminishing.  Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.            Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that with appropriate policy accommodation economic activity will expand at a moderate pace with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year.            The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in October the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $5 billion per month rather than $10 billion per month and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $10 billion per month rather than $15 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.            The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective the Committee will end its current program of asset purchases at its next meeting.  However asset purchases are not on a preset course and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.            To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.

Fisher and Charles I.  Plosser.  President Fisher believed that the continued strengthening of the real economy improved outlook for labor utilization and for general price stability and continued signs of financial market excess will likely warrant an earlier reduction in monetary accommodation than is suggested by the Committee's stated forward guidance.  President Plosser objected to the guidance indicating that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for ""a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends"" because such language is time dependent and does not reflect the considerable economic progress that has been made toward the Committee's goals.                 "
17/09/2014,"                  During its recent meetings the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) discussed ways to normalize the stance of monetary policy and the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.  The discussions were part of prudent planning and do not imply that normalization will necessarily begin soon.  The Committee continues to judge that many of the normalization principles that it adopted in June 2011 remain applicable.  However in light of the changes in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio since 2011 and enhancements in the tools the Committee will have available to implement policy during normalization the Committee has concluded that some aspects of the eventual normalization process will likely differ from those specified earlier.  The Committee also has agreed that it is appropriate at this time to provide additional information regarding its normalization plans.  All FOMC participants but one agreed on the following key elements of the approach they intend to implement when it becomes appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy:    "
29/10/2014,"       Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.  Labor market conditions improved somewhat further with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate.  On balance a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources is gradually diminishing.  Household spending is rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.            Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that with appropriate policy accommodation economic activity will expand at a moderate pace with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.  Although inflation in the near term will likely be held down by lower energy prices and other factors the Committee judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year.            The Committee judges that there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market since the inception of its current asset purchase program.  Moreover the Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability.  Accordingly the Committee decided to conclude its asset purchase program this month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  This policy by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.            To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.

The Committee anticipates based on its current assessment that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  However if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.  Conversely if progress proves slower than expected then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.            When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels economic conditions may for some time warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.             Voting against the action was Narayana Kocherlakota who believed that in light of continued sluggishness in the inflation outlook and the recent slide in market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations the Committee should commit to keeping the current target range for the federal funds rate at least until the one-to-two-year ahead inflation outlook has returned to 2 percent and should continue the asset purchase program at its current level.                 "

The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady.  Nonetheless labor market indicators on balance show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved slightly lower; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.           Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that with appropriate policy accommodation economic activity will expand at a moderate pace with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring global economic and financial developments.  Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.           To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.           The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  This policy by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.           When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels economic conditions may for some time warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.           Voting against the action was Jeffrey M.  Lacker who preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting.     "
16/12/2015,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months and the housing sector has improved further; however net exports have been soft.  A range of recent labor market indicators including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged down. Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.  Overall taking into account domestic and international developments the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced.  Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. The Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise over the medium term to its 2 percent objective.  Given the economic outlook and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. 
27/01/2016,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year.  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months and the housing sector has improved further; however net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed.  A range of recent labor market indicators including strong job gains points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed on balance in recent months. Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term in part because of the further declines in energy prices but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation and for the balance of risks to the outlook. Given the economic outlook the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.

27/04/2016,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that labor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity appears to have slowed.  Growth in household spending has moderated although households' real income has risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remains high.  Since the beginning of the year the housing sector has improved further but business fixed investment and net exports have been soft.  A range of recent indicators including strong job gains points to additional strengthening of the labor market.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of non-energy imports.

15/06/2016,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in economic activity appears to have picked up.  Although the unemployment rate has declined job gains have diminished.  Growth in household spending has strengthened.  Since the beginning of the year the housing sector has continued to improve and the drag from net exports appears to have lessened but business fixed investment has been soft.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.

27/07/2016,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market strengthened and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate.  Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.  On balance payrolls and other labor market indicators point to some increase in labor utilization in recent months.  Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment has been soft.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.

21/09/2016,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year.  Although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months job gains have been solid on average.  Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment has remained soft.

15/03/2017,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in February indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace.  Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months.  Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment appears to have firmed somewhat.  Inflation has increased in recent quarters moving close to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective; excluding energy and food prices inflation was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent.

Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3/4 to 1 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.

03/05/2017,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen even as growth in economic activity slowed.  Job gains were solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate declined.  Household spending rose only modestly but the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remained solid.  Business fixed investment firmed.  Inflation measured on a 12-month basis recently has been running close to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.  Excluding energy and food consumer prices declined in March and inflation continued to run somewhat below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory and continues to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 3/4 to 1 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
14/06/2017,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year.  Job gains have moderated but have been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate has declined.  Household spending has picked up in recent months and business fixed investment has continued to expand.  On a 12-month basis inflation has declined recently and like the measure excluding food and energy prices is running somewhat below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee continues to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.  Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1-1/4 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated.  This program which would gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments from those securities is described in the accompanying addendum to the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.  Voting against the action was Neel Kashkari who preferred at this meeting to maintain the existing target range for the federal funds rate. 
26/07/2017,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year.  Job gains have been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate has declined.  Household spending and business fixed investment have continued to expand.  On a 12-month basis overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined and are running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.

For the time being the Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee expects to begin implementing its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated; this program is described in the June 2017 Addendum to the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.  
20/09/2017,Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year.  Job gains have remained solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters.  On a 12-month basis overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined this year and are running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  Hurricanes Harvey Irma and Maria have devastated many communities inflicting severe hardship.  Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.  Consequently the Committee continues to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.  Higher prices for gasoline and some other items in the aftermath of the hurricanes will likely boost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.

In October the Committee will initiate the balance sheet normalization program described in the June 2017 Addendum to the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.
